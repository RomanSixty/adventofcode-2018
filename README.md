# Advent of Code 2018
http://adventofcode.com/2018

## Goals

* write **as little code as possible**
* while maintaining **readability**
* try maximizing **performance**
* **no dependencies**, just a PHP7 environment

## Usage

Each day's solution resides in a numbered directory containing a text file `input` as input data and `solve.php` for processing.

Run using php-cli, e.g.:

`php 01/solve.php`
